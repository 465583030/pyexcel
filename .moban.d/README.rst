.. code-block:: python

    >>> # pip install pyexcel-text==0.2.7.1
    >>> import pyexcel as p
    >>> ccs_insight2 = p.Sheet()
    >>> ccs_insight2.name = "Worldwide Mobile Phone Shipments (Billions), 2017-2021"
    >>> ccs_insight2.ndjson = """

Suppose you have the following data in a dictionary:

========= ====
Name      Age
========= ====
Adam      28
Beatrice  29
Ceri      30
Dean      26
========= ====

you can easily save it into an excel file, using the following code.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyexcel
   >>> # make sure you had pyexcel-xls installed
   >>> a_list_of_dictionaries = [
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Adam',
   ...         "Age": 28
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Beatrice',
   ...         "Age": 29
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Ceri',
   ...         "Age": 30
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Dean',
   ...         "Age": 26
   ...     }
   ... ]
   >>> pyexcel.save_as(records=a_list_of_dictionaries, dest_file_name="your_file.xls")


Here are the method to obtain the records:

.. code-block:: python
   
   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> records = pe.iget_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> for record in records:
   ...     print("%s is aged at %d" % (record['Name'], record['Age']))
   Adam is aged at 28
   Beatrice is aged at 29
   Ceri is aged at 30
   Dean is aged at 26
   >>> pe.free_resources()
